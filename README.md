## 📚 Universal Forecasting Transformers

### **[MOIRAI: Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02592)**
- **Authors**: Gerald Woo, Chenghao Liu, Akshat Kumar, et al.
- **Abstract**: MOIRAI is a universal time series forecasting framework based on a masked encoder architecture. It tackles challenges like multi-frequency learning, any-variate forecasting, and flexible distribution modeling. Trained on the LOTSA dataset with over 27 billion observations, MOIRAI achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot and in-distribution tasks.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Any-Variate Attention mechanism for handling arbitrary variable dimensions.
  - LOTSA, a large-scale open dataset for pre-training.
  - Mixture distributions for probabilistic forecasting.

### **[TimesFM: A Decoder-Only Foundation Model for Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10688)**
- **Authors**: A. Das, W. Kong, et al.
- **Abstract**: TimesFM introduces a decoder-only transformer framework for time-series forecasting, inspired by language model architectures. It achieves near-supervised performance in zero-shot settings and demonstrates strong long-range forecasting capabilities.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Patch-based input/output design for flexible predictions.
  - Pre-trained on large-scale real-world and synthetic data.


### **[Chronos: Learning the Language of Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01728)**
- **Authors**: N. Gruver, M. Finzi, et al.
- **Abstract**: Chronos leverages natural language pre-training paradigms for time series forecasting by tokenizing time series data into discrete tokens. It employs synthetic data generation techniques to augment training and achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - TSMixup and KernelSynth for data augmentation.
  - Use of language modeling techniques for forecasting.
